The current generation of mobile networks is not designed to meet the future demand for high data rate, low latency
communications, support a large number of users. The IMT 2020 has categorized the requirements as enhanced Mobile Broadband
(eMBB), Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC), massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). The
Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has been actively working to define the specifications for next-generation 5G
communications to address the requirements. The 3GPP is working across the Core Network (CN) and Radio Access Network
(RAN) to meet the requirements. One of the proposed techniques to support a large number of users and high spectral efficiency
on the radio multiple access is Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) scheme. This paper provides a study of NOMA, how
NOMA addresses the 5G requirements, ongoing standardization efforts for NOMA and a comparative study of NOMA with other
OMA schemes like OFDMA. We have also demonstrated improvements in the throughput of the users in NOMA as compared
to OFDMA with the help of MATLAB simulations.
